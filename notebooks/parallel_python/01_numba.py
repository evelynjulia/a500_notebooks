# # Using numba to release the GIL

# ### Timing python code
# 
# 
# One easy way to tell whether you are utilizing multiple cores is to track the wall clock time measured by [time.perf_counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter) against the total cpu time used by all threads meausred with [time.process_time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time)
# 
# I'll organize these two timers using the [contexttimer](https://github.com/brouberol/contexttimer) module.

# To install, in a shell window type:
# 
#      pip install contexttimer

# #### Define a function that does a lot of computation

# %%


def wait_loop(n):
    """
    Function under test.
    """
    for m in range(n):
        for l in range(m):
            for j in range(l):
                for i in range(j):
                    i=i+4
                    out=math.sqrt(i)
                    out=out**2.
    return out


# #### now time it with pure python

# %%


nloops=200
with contexttimer.Timer(time.perf_counter) as pure_wall:
    with contexttimer.Timer(time.process_time) as pure_cpu:
        result=wait_loop(nloops)
print(f'pure python wall time {pure_wall.elapsed} and cpu time {pure_cpu.elapsed}')


# ### Now try this with numba
# 
# Numba is a just in time compiler that can turn a subset of python into machine code using the llvm compiler.
# 
# Reference:  [Numba documentation](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/index.html)

# ### Make two identical functions: one that releases and one that holds the GIL
